# chromewrapper
Wrapper to persist flags for Chrome in Windows

This uses some utilities from [Henry++'s chrlauncher](https://github.com/henrypp/chrlauncher) to set the batch file as the default web handler, these tools are MIT licensed

Usage explained in my [chromium hardening guide for Windows](https://github.com/RKNF404/chromium-hardening-guide/blob/main/SETUP_GUIDE.md#windows-1).
